# Advanced Statistics with R

This repository serves as my personal workspace for the Physics of Data course "Advanced Statistics" held by Prof. Alberto Garfagnini.

There I'll be organizing lecture materials, completing exercises, and collaborating with peers on projects.

## Course Overview
The course will cover advanced statistical concepts and their practical application using the R framework. 
From a review of fundamental concepts to exploring topics like Bernoulli trials, Poisson processes, Monte Carlo methods and inference. 


## Learning Objectives
- Develop a strong grasp of advanced statistical concepts.
- Enhance proficiency in solving practical statistical problems using the R framework.
- Gain insight into inference methods for various parameters and distributions.
- Collaborate with peers on group projects to apply learned concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Credits
All the material has been provided by Prof. Alberto Garfagnini, from the University of Padua.
