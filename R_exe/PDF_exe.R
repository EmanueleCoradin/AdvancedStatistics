#Ann and Maggie are playing cards until one of them wins 5 games
#suppose all games are independent and the probability that Ann wins is 58%
# what is the probability that they complete in 7 games
#if the series ends in 7 games, what is the probability that Ann wins ?

#------------- BINOMIAL vs POISSON ------------- 

#a company produces screws
#the probability of a screw to be defective is p = 0.015
#a box with n = 100 screws is packaged.
#Compute:
# the probability that all screws are non defective
# the defective screws distribution comparing the Binomial and Poisson distributions
# how many extra screws should the box contain in order to have n = 100 non
# defective screws with probability greater than 80%

#------------- POISSON PROCESS ------------- 
rate <- 5/(24*60) #birth rate per hour
#1) Probability that at least 2 babies are born in 6 hours

P <- 

#------------- EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION ------------- 
# Î”T of events from a Poisson distribuition follows an exponential distribution
